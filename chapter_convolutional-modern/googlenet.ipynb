        "and a cocktail of convolution kernels. It was arguably also the first network that exhibited a clear distinction among the stem (data ingest), body (data processing), and head (prediction) in a CNN. This design pattern has persisted ever since in the design of deep networks: the *stem* is given by the first two or three convolutions that operate on the image. They extract low-level features from the underlying images. This is followed by a *body* of convolutional blocks. Finally, the *head* maps the features obtained so far to the required classification, segmentation, detection, or tracking problem at hand.\n",
